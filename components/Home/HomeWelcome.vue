        For the past 35+ years the
        <b>Center for Systematic Entomology (CSE)</b> has served as a non-profit
        organization designed to further systematics in its broadest sense. It
        has supported the
        <a
          href="https://thefsca.org"
          target="_blank"
          class="fsca-link"
          >Florida State Collection of Arthropods (FSCA)</a
        >
        The CSE has also provided a number of grants for specialists to study at
        the FSCA. Because the Research Associate program supports insect
        systematics in many of the same ways, we believe that membership in CSE
        provides another way that Research Associates can assist.

      <p>Publications of the CSE include:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6">
        <li><b>CSE Newsletter</b> (discontinued after 2003)</li>
        <li><b>Insecta Mundi (IM)</b> - a journal devoted exclusively to arthropod systematics</li>
        <li><b>CSE Memoirs Series</b></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="flex flex-col gap-4 my-8">
      <p>
        One of the advantages of membership is 
        publishing in <b>IM</b> without page charges. We urge all 
        Research Associates to support the CSE and simultaneously support FSCA 
        and its various systematics projects. 
        For $40 you can be an important part of this effort. Please
