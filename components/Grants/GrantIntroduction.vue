          In 2021, Stewart and Jarmila Peck established the Stewart and Jarmila
          Peck Collection Enhancement Endowment (the Peck Fund) with the Center
          for Systematic Entomology (CSE). The primary purpose of the endowment is
          to help students and researchers travel to the Florida State Collection
          of Arthropods (FSCA) to work with and ultimately improve the
          collections.
