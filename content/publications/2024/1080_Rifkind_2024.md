abstract: '<i>Cymatodera campbelli</i>, <b>new species</b> (Coleoptera: Cleridae), is described from central Arizona. Though superficially similar to several other small species of Southwestern <i>Cymatodera</i> Gray that are commonly collected at lights, this apparently rare species has distinctive coloration and surface sculpturing. Its discovery suggests that systematic collecting even in areas that have historically attracted entomological attention may still yield additions to our fauna.'
